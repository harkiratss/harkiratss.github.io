excerpt: 'We explore the question, whether the accelerated detector is sensitive to the Planck order shift in its causal domain? This question is addressed in the context of a nested sequence of Rindler observers, where the vacua of preceding Rindler frames appear thermally populated to a shifted Rindler frame. The Bogoliubov analysis relies on the global notion of the quantum field theory and turns out to be insensitive to the local character of these horizon shifts. We investigate this system by means of the Unruh-DeWitt detector and show that this local probe of the quantum field theory is sensitive enough to capture the horizon shifts of the order of the Planck scale.'

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
