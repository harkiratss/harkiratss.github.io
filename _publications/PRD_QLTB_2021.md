title: "Infrared signatures of a quantum bounce in a minisuperspace analysis of Lema√Ætre-Tolman-Bondi dust collapse"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2110.06247
excerpt: 'We study the mode decomposition of a unitarily evolving wave packet that represents the quantum dynamics of the dust cloud in Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi geometry. We showed that the infrared sector of the dust profile predominantly contributes to the emission during the collapsing phase and therefore, is most relevant for the Hawking radiation.
