excerpt: 'We investigate the viability of an effective quantum-corrected spacetime defined by expectation value of the metric variables in quantum cosmology. For this effective geometry, we ask; how the ordering choice affects this notion, what are the quantum fluctuations in this {\it quantum geometry}, and whether its observables have any correspondence with the true {\it quantum observables}. Surprisingly, we find that the ordering choices not only affect physics near singularity but creep well into the classical regime.'
