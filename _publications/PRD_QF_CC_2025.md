title: "Non-local correlations of a test quantum field in gravitational collapse"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: "Quantum correlations across the horizon could be pivotal in unveiling the puzzles surrounding quantum aspects of black holes and Hawking radiation. The peaks in the equal time correlation function are typically attributed to the entangled particle excitations. In this work, we investigate the evolution of the correlations of a test quantum field on a dynamical background spacetime undergoing gravitational collapse. In the case of super-critical collapse, as the black hole and its horizon forms, correlated peaks are seen to appear across the horizon, representing an entangled Hawking pair. The outside peak moves away from the horizon as the system evolves, possibly representing outgoing Hawking flux. The implications of these non-local correlations are discussed in light of information paradox, quantum atmosphere and analogue black holes. "
