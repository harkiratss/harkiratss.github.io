I am a theoretical physicist currently working as a Research Associate at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. My research lies at the intersection of quantum theory and gravitation, exploring fundamental questions that arise when these two pillars of modern physics meet.

Below are a few visual excerpts from my recent works.

The quantum dynamics of the FLRW universe with dust and a positive cosmological constant. The universe undergoes a quantum bounce, captured through the probability distribution, expectation value, and quantum uncertainty of the volume, evaluated for a unitarily evolving wave packet. In the figure, the heatmap represents the probability distribution associated with the wave packet. The solid black curve shows the expectation value of the volume, the dotted black curves indicate the classical trajectory, and the gray dashed lines mark the region of quantum uncertainty.

The corresponding results for a negative cosmological constant, highlighting the contrasting dynamics where the quantum universe undergoes cyclic evolution in this case. In the figure, the heatmap represents the probability distribution associated with the wave packet. The solid black curve shows the expectation value of the volume, the dotted black curves indicate the classical trajectory, and the gray dashed lines mark the region of quantum uncertainty.

Quantum correlations of a test field propagating in a spacetime undergoing critical collapse, evaluated at the end of the numerical simulation. The black dashed lines mark the areal radius of apparent horizon and dashed red lines mark the location of apparent horizon.
