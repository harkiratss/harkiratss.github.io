I am a theoretical physicist currently working as a Research Associate at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. My research lies at the intersection of quantum theory and gravitation, exploring fundamental questions that arise when these two pillars of modern physics meet.

Below are a few visual excerpts from my recent works.
The first figure shows the quantum dynamics of the FLRW universe with dust and a positive cosmological constant. The universe undergoes quantum bounce as depicted by probability distribution, the expectation value and quantum uncertainty of the volume of universe for a wave packet.
The second figure depicts the corresponding results for a negative cosmological constant, highlighting the contrasting dynamics where the quantum universe undergoing cyclic evolution.
Finally, the third figure captures quantum correlations of a test field propagating in a spacetime undergoing critical gravitational collapse, taken from the endpoint of a numerical simulation.
