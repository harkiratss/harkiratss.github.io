I am a theoretical physicist working at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi as a research associate. My research focusses on everything quantum and gravity. Here are a few snippnets from my works. The first figure contain the probability distribution and the expectation value of the volume of universe for a semiclassical wave packet for positive cosmological constant. The second figure is for the case of a negative cosmological constant. The last figure shows the quantum correlation of a test quantum field in the background spacetime undergoing critical collapse at the end of the simulation.
